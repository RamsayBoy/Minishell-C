## How to build it
### ATTENTION
For now, it is a little mess but I will find out better ways of doing it (and it will be all automatic).

### Creating the necessary directories
First, run the following command:
```
make create_dirs
```
This will create 2 folders: /bin and /obj.

### Building it
Once done it, it will be possible to execute this command:
```
make
```
And that is all.

### Want to clean?
For cleaning all, just execute ```make clean``` and the folders /bin and /obj will be cleaned.
